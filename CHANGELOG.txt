* Initial port to Drupal 7.
* Changed the module to load the qTip script from sites/all/libraries.
* Small optimization - split the JS into two files so less code is loaded for
  most page views.
* Don't continue trying to load the menus if the qTip JS file has not been
  installed.
* If no Mini Panels are available, show a message on the menu admin page.
* Fixed a JS error that would occur if some of the main menu items did not
  contain a minipanel definition.
* Changed some labels to be less confusing.
* Changed the defaults so that the minipanel shows up underneath the menu,
  rather than on top.
